Keeping track of changes, tasks and problems on a project is conducted 
in GitHub through a tracker called Issues. (1) Issues is sort of like email 
but can be shared and discussed with others and it is available in each 
repository. (1) An issue is editable, indicates who created the issue, the 
total number of comments for the issue, who created those comments and there 
is a indication of how many days ago the issue was created as well as how 
many days ago each comment was made. (1) There is a title and description 
for each issue, color-coded lables assist with categorizing and filtering 
issues, milestones can associate issues with specific features or project 
phases, and the aforementioned comments allow anyone with access to the 
repository to provide feedback or ask questions. (1) Milestones, labels, 
and assignees allow filtering and categorization of issues. These three 
features are created or changed through gears on the rightside sidebar. (1) 
Milestones are issues grouped together that correspond to a particular 
project. (1) Labels help organize different types of issues and can be used 
more than once on a particular issue allowing filtering by one or more 
labels at one time. (1) An assignee is the one person responsible for 
moving the issue forward and are selected in the same way as milestones, 
through the grey bar at the top of that issue. (1) 

Notifications keep users up to date on issues by finding out about new 
issues on repositories and can be received via email and the web. (1) 
This is configurable through settings and can be set up to receive web and 
email notifications for Participating and web notifications for Watching. (1)
Participating is when the user is notified of participating in a discussion 
or someone brings the user in with an @mention. (1) Watching is receving 
updates to any repositories or threads the user is watching. (1) @mentions 
are how other GitHub users are referenced inside of GitHub issues so inside 
the description or comment of an issue, including the @username of another 
GitHub user will send them a notification. (1) The syntax /cc may be used 
to carbon copy people on issues like in email. (1) However, if it is not 
clear who should be cc'd, @mentions also work for Teams within your GitHub 
organization and can be refenerenced with @mentions as well. (1) Issues 
can also be referenced directly from commits by including the issue number 
inside of a commit message. (1) By prefacing the commit with "Fixes", 
"Fixed", "Fix", "Closes", "Closed", or "Close" when the commit is merged 
into master, the issue will automatically close. (1) 

Documenting a project properly is key to a project's success and can be 
done with README files and wikis. (2) README files are a quick, simple 
way for others to learn about another's work while wikis on GitHub help 
present in-depth information about a project. (2) The README is recommended 
as a minimum because this should be the first thing that others will read 
when first encountering another's work. (2) README's can be initialized 
when creating a new repository and should have within the project's name 
at the top, then have a description about the contents. (2) It should 
also have a table of contents, installation instructions, usage, 
contributing instructions, credits with links to other project authors, 
and a section for the license of the project. (2) 

A wiki is created through the sidebar navigation of a repository by 
creating the first wiki page and depositing information in any format 
supported by GitHub Markup. (2) Custom folders can be included for items 
like contact details or project license information. (2) Changes are 
tracked by showing who made the most recent edits as well as the number 
of commits made to the page. (2) Additional pages can be added by 
utilizing New Page in the upper right corner and each page added is 
included automatically in the wiki's sidebar in alphabetical order. (2)
